# SQL-Projects

My repository  contains all the SQL projects I have done from the course Break Into Tech by Charlotte Chaze as well as a few others outside of the course. This contains my skills on developing basic SQL queries, doing JOIN tables, and a few other advanced technqiues on following scenarios from store analytics to Netflix databases.

# Course Projects
Goal: In this project, I write my own SQL code to query a Superstore Database that I made. This is an example of data used at a company like Costco, Amazon, Walmart, TJ Maxx, Target, CVS, Dollar General, or Home Depot.

Techniques: Using basic SQL queries such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and aggregate functions such as SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT()

Key Skills: Gained a good understanding of using basic SQL queries to grab and filter data in a store company's database

# Fortune 500
Goal: This project allows me to be open ended on what I use. The Fortune 500 is a list of the 500 companies with the most revenue and that are typically regarded as some of the best places to work.

Techniques: tI used a CASE statement to categorize companies into different revenue tiers, using HAVING clause only when using aggregate functions since WHERE cannot be used with an aggergate function like SUM() for example, and using AND with multiple filters in WHERE

Key Skills: Understood the purpose of CASE statements to categorize data in tiers, and using HAVING as a substitute in aggregate functions for filtering

# Netflix Database Analysis
Goal: This project allows me to make a database in a Netflix Database to determine how many movies and films the company provides to its streamers. Analayzing streaming statisitcs to idendtify viewing trends and to analyze data to see which genres and movie titles are seen by the most audience

Techniques: Using a variety JOINS such as INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN on certain situations to combine tables rows that have data in common as well as creating multiple JOIN table statements for more than two

Key Skills: Utlized the JOIN types to combine tables and their data on what they have in common.

# Customer & Order Analytics
Goal: This project uses SQL to analyze customer behaviours and order patterns. By working with a sample database downloaded and installed into SQLite, the goal is to derive insights 
from transactional data, categorize customers, and evaluate purchasing trends, helping businesses optimize their strategies based on data-driven decisions. 

Techniques: Utilizing a variety of SQL queries from WHERE filters, using AND for multiple conditions, using INNER JOIN to find distinct account numbers between customers and FebSales tables from BIT_DB database, GROUP BY the values of product and price, and using a mix of two aggregate functions with LEFT JOIN along with two WHERE filters.

Key Skills: Combined a variety of queries to get specific data from the customers and orders analytics

# Spotify Data Analytics Project

Goal: Using a Spotify dataset to look up songs, soundtracks, and music artists to look into music duration, danceability, popularity, loudness, etc.

Techniques: Use CREATE TABLE for a comprehensive list of columns for each song and its artists from the Excel file. I imported data from an Excel csv file by cicking Import from Tools, selecting BIT_DB as database name, and naming new table Spotifydata. I came up with my own SQL query questions after doing this

Key Skills: Focusing on how to import an csv file into Excel for SQLite. Inserted my own questions by my own judgement to create a variety of SQL statements

# Final SQL Project

Goal: The project focused on using a music store schema to gather and filter data for a music store. This is a comprehensive project to test my SQL skills.

Techniques: A project that tests my skills from creating basic SQL queries using WHERE, AND, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY as well as using advanced JOIN type tables to combine tables.

Key Skills: I created this file to demonstrate how to navigate the music store's data tables by starting out small and working my way up to more complex scenarios.
