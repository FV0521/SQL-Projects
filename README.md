# SQL-Projects

My repository  contains all the SQL projects I have done from the course Break Into Tech by Charlotte Chaze as well as a few others outside of the course. This contains my skills on developing basic SQL queries, doing JOIN tables, and a few other advanced technqiues on following scenarios from store analytics to Netflix databases.

# Course Projects
Goal: In this project, I write my own SQL code to query a Superstore Database that I made. This is an example of data used at a company like Costco, Amazon, Walmart, TJ Maxx, Target, CVS, Dollar General, or Home Depot.
