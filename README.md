# SQL-Projects

My repository  contains all the SQL projects I have done from the course Break Into Tech by Charlotte Chaze as well as a few others outside of the course. This contains my skills on developing basic SQL queries, doing JOIN tables, and a few other advanced technqiues on following scenarios from store analytics to Netflix databases.

# Course Projects
Goal: In this project, I write my own SQL code to query a Superstore Database that I made. This is an example of data used at a company like Costco, Amazon, Walmart, TJ Maxx, Target, CVS, Dollar General, or Home Depot.
Techniques: Using basic SQL queries such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and aggregate functions such as SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT()
Key Skills: Gained a good understanding of using basic SQL queries to grab and filter data in a store company's database

# Fortune 500
Goal: This project allows me to be open ended on what I use. The Fortune 500 is a list of the 500 companies with the most revenue and that are typically regarded as some of the best places to work.
Techniques: tI used a CASE statement to categorize companies into different revenue tiers, using HAVING clause only when using aggregate functions since WHERE cannot be used with an aggergate function like SUM() for example, and using AND with multiple filters in WHERE
Key Skills: Understood the purpose of CASE statements to categorize data in tiers, and using HAVING as a substitute in aggregate functions for filtering

# Netflix Database Analysis
Goal: This project allows me to make a database in a Netflix Database to determine how many movies and films the company provides to its streamers. Analayzing streaming statisitcs to idendtify viewing trends and to analyze data to see which genres and movie titles are seen by the most audience
Techniques: Using a variety JOINS such as INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN on certain situations to combine tables rows that have data in common as well as creating multiple JOIN table statements for more than two
Key Skills: Utlized the JOIN types to combine tables and their data on what they have in common.
