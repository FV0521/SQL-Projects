-- wrote  a SQL statement that shows a statisitc about price for items in category of "Kitchen Supplies". Using single quotes as it is Case Sensative to not use them for Kitcehn Supplies, the name of the category
SELECT SUM(price)

-- made my own SQL question where I seek out the average from the superstore database, and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses. I sorted by using ORDER BY in descending order
